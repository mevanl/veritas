Ideas/Features To Implement or not
----------
Setting Feature: DefaultSettings.JSON read, UserSettings.JSON read, ProjectSettings.JSON read and implemeneted,
                 Write over previous settings loaded. 

                 Default settings.JSON will be created the first time the application is ran, this is good way to keep track
                 of if veritas has been opened before

MainWindowArea: Abstract parent class that is never used itself. Child of it could be like TextWindowArea class that has special 
                methods for just it. It will also have an SDL_Rect to define where it is, bool isShown(), bool loadOnTrigger(), etc.
